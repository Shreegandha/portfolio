        <p class="card-text">Hi. My name is Shreegandha Kulkarni, and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School.
          </p>
<p class="card-text"> I was raised to believe that building a career and receiving a good education were both integral factors in my life. The majority of my family members, including my dad, are computer science engineers, so it is natural that I should possess the roots for the career. </p>
<p class="card-text"> Starting high school and getting to roam around through my interests, both science and engineering stood out to me. Mid-freshman year, I finally decided to focus on the field of genetic engineering. The combination of science and technology led to me contributing my mind and soul into this intriguing and charismatic career. </p>
  <p class="card-text"> I plan on progressing in volunteering to help create technological features in gadgets for children to use and continuing to take engineer-related courses over my high school years. I hope to develop my knowledge and my passion for engineering further. </p>
<p class="card-text"> I believe that life is a work experience and it’s important to know our strengths and weaknesses to make sure it corresponds to our dream career. One of the qualities that many of my peers have seemed to indicate is that I am an ambitious individual. Whether it’s pushing myself to get a goal for my soccer team or sprinting to my next class to avoid getting marked tardy, I contain a strong desire and commitment not to give up and try, try again. I feel as if I hold a versatile personality as well. I have been playing soccer since I was ten and been in competitive swimming since seven years of age. I’ve continued playing soccer for my school’s team and been doing vocal performance at the same time since the age of 13. </p>
<p class="card-text"> In light of seizing this career, I have volunteered at the Alameda County Library for minor activities such as Game Night and holiday festivals as well as several events hosted by Kaiser Permanente to establish a comfortable, learning environment for children ages 7-13. One of the technological activities that were provided as an entertainment usage was Google 4-D goggles. In words for using this innovation, once putting on the goggles, users will be open to a new dimension, but of course through sight alone. In this process, I helped program minor parts of the goggles as well as assisted the children, making them laugh and have a wonderful time. </p>
<p class="card-text"> Although I am working towards my career, it is not certain whether I will pursue it 100% considering that I still have 2 ½ years of high school to go. Some days, I take time to research colleges that would best fit my career choice, or search up SAT scores suitable to get into that college. I realize that I have a long road ahead of me and along with that, a great measure of time to explore more in the expansion of careers. I have expanded my passion just to the profession of genetic engineering and have gained an understanding of what fields interest me. </p>
<p class="card-text"> Feel free to contact me if you have any questions and explore this website to learn about my interests, achievements, and more.</p>
